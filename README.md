# List of useful recipes

I use this as a repository as a copy/paste reference in my daily development work. Mostly around the Drupal universe.

## Getting Started

I can't guarantee that recipes will work, so please check if syntax didn't change on project docs.

### Prerequisites

Install Lando, Gulp, Acquia dev, etc.


### Using



With Lando installed, in terminal and project folder

```
lando init
```
paste recipe in .lando.yml file

```
lando start
```
